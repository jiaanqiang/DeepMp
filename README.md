DeepMp is a deep learning framework for the identification and prediction of microproteins. It facilitates the screening of genomically encoded microproteins through deep learning-based prediction. The core of the framework is a model trained on Arabidopsis and rice data, which shows strong performance on key metrics and can be applied to systematically identify microproteins in other species. To predict microproteins in a new plant species, users can fine-tune or retrain the model by incorporating its genomic sequences.
