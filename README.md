DeepMp is a deep learning framework designed for the identification and prediction of microproteins. It enables systematic screening of genomically encoded microproteins through deep learning–based prediction. The core of the framework is a model trained on Arabidopsis and rice datasets, which demonstrates strong performance across key evaluation metrics and can be extended to identify microproteins in other species. For new plant species, users can fine-tune or retrain the model by incorporating their microprotein sequences.
